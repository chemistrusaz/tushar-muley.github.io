<br/>

A case study on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and coding of bring together different types of data sets 
to perform the analysis of what it takes to win in Formula 1 racing. Includes merging of driver information data, racing tracks information, with 
manufactory data and various complex data transformation to complete the analysis. Using Python to perform the EDA with data from 1950 to 2020 in 
determining the direction the sport has taken. The analysis provided information on winning driver age and successful constructors.<br>

The Austin, Texas Metro area has seen an increase in population of 34% compared to the 2010 Census confirmed by the most recent Census data 
released in May of 2021. These new settlers are looking for affordable housing as they move into the newest tech hub outside of the 
traditional hubs like Silicon Valley and Seattle. Our team was tasked with building a machine learning model that will take our housing 
data and train against that data to make predictions on home prices in the Austin area. We were given a data set with over 15,000 
rows all containing various features and information that Zillow contains for analysis.<br> 

Our goal was to accurately predict the prices of homes in the Austin market for families and individuals coming to work in the rapidly 
growing area. In the beginning we had to analyze the data and begin our preparation for the model we built. Features where updated from 
human language to model ready input. With further analysis we then began to split and train the data trying to add or delete irrelevant 
features from the training data.<br>

As automobiles are contributor to health and global warming many of the worldâ€™s largest city are looking to limit their usage or band them from 
entering city centers. Enter a possible solution to getting around. New bike sharing companies are showing up in a majority of city. In the 
United States bike sharing program started in 2007 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The growth has been stead since and is expected to increase from 
$1.5 billion in 2020 to $4.4 billion by 2027.

In this case study I took data from Metro Bike's found in Los Angeles, California. I used the data to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to better 
understand some key elements to bike sharing. I asked my data to provide answer to the below questions. 

1.	If how ridership changes throughout the year. 
2.	How do weekdays compare to weekend for bike sharing? 
3.	Does having a riding membership increase bike usage compared to the casual rider?
4.	Identifying the top busiest bike stations
5.	What features influence trip count?

For my final question.
6.	Could the data be used to predict the number of trips for a station?

Lending institution have a basic need to be able to accurately determine the riskiness of the individuals applying for a loan. It is one of their 
biggest concerns as the margin for return is low and cost of servicing loans is high. Automation has assisted in lowering costs for servicing loans 
but loan losses add to the cost. All financial lending institutions want to be able to lend to as many individuals as possible. They want to see a 
recognized return in the form of returned principal and income as interest. The goal is to identify, which attributes better determine the riskiness 
of the individuals that financial organization lending money to. I am proposing we determine if more features or different features are need to predict 
the riskiness of the individuals before lending money to them.

<img src="images/caraccidents.png?raw=true"/> <br>

This case study surrounded analysis performed on car accident data to determine some of the factors that caused the most amounts of accidents. Using R 
to perform the analysis to determine common factors like time of day, street type (surface street, interstates, or state routes), traffic controls and 
points of interest, using logistics regression to determine the severity of accidents from contributing factors like weather, street type, time of day 
and traffic controls.

A coding assignment that assisted in helping MLB Los Angeles Dodgers in discovering the best day of the week and promotion (give away) to increase 
attendance. Different types of charts including boxplots, scatter plots, correlation chart and bar charts were employed for graphical data exploration. 
After EDA a Regression model was utilized to determine the day of the week and which promotion to be used to increase attendance.
