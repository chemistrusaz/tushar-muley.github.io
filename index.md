#### **Case Study on Formula 1 International Racing Analysis**
      A case study on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and
      coding of bring together different types of data sets 
      to perform the analysis of what it takes to win in 
      Formula 1 racing. Includes merging of driver 
      information data, racing tracks information, with 
      manufactory data and various complex data 
      transformation to complete the analysis. Using Python 
      to perform the EDA with data from 1950 to 2020 in 
      determining the direction the sport has taken. 
      The analysis provided information on winning driver 
      age and successful constructors.

#### **Austin Housing Market Prediction Analysis**
      The Austin, Texas Metro area has seen an increase in 
      population of 34% compared to the 2010 Census confirmed 
      by the most recent Census data released in May of 2021. 
      These new settlers are looking for affordable housing as 
      they move into the newest tech hub outside of the 
      traditional hubs like Silicon Valley and Seattle. 
      Our team was tasked with building a machine learning 
      model that will take our housing data and train against 
      that data to make predictions on home prices in the 
      Austin area. We were given a data set with over 15,000 
      rows all containing various features and information 
      that Zillow contains for analysis. 

      Our goal was to accurately predict the prices of homes in 
      the Austin market for families and individuals coming to 
      work in the rapidly growing area. In the beginning we had 
      to analyze the data and begin our preparation for the model 
      we built. Features where updated from human language to 
      model ready input. With further analysis we then began to 
      split and train the data trying to add or delete irrelevant 
      features from the training data.
